# 0.1 Automota, Computability, and Complexity

What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?

Complexity (classify problems as easy or hard)
  What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?
    We don't really know, but we have "an elegant scheme for classifying problems according to their computational difficulty"
  3 options for dealing with a computationally hard problem
    Factor the problem to find the root of the difficulty; simplify the problem
    Settle for a less an approximate solution
    Settle for a solution that's quick enough most of the time

Computability (classify problems as solvable or unsolvable)
  Certain basic problems cannot be solved by computers (no algorithm can perform the task)
    Proven by Godel, Turing, Church!
    e.g. the problem of determining whether a mathematical statement is true of false

Automata
  Definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation


# 0.2 Mathematical Notions and Terminology

Sets
  A SET is a group of objects represented as a unit, e.g. set of sets
    The objects are called ELEMENTS or MEMBERS
  Give 2 sets A and B, A is a SUBSET of B if every member of A is also in B
    A is a PROPER SUBSET of B if A is a subset of B and not equal to B
  Order doesn't matter in sets!
  Repitition doesn't matter, no real duplicates!
    MULTISETS take the number of occurances of members into account
  an INFINITE set contains infinitely many elements
    bonus: Countably infinite vs Uncountably infinite sets, e.g. Z vs R
  the EMPTY set has 0 members
  the UNION of two sets is the set that combines all their members
  the INTERSECTION of two sets is the set of members in both
